Navigus Assignment1


          Hi in this assignment I have developed a simple user interface using Flask framework that contains User home page,login Page (for exisiting user) and Signup page (for those who are new to the page can use this). And used postgresql as a database in the backend in order to store the profiles of the users those who are signedup and also to validate the sigined in user.
          The modules in this assignment are well tested based on unit tests. Such as, the home page is tested as if the anonymous user without login try to access the page then he will not be able to see the dashboard page because without login he is not permitted and in order to maintain the security of the user crendtials all the password provided by the user and profile pics (avatar) are encrypted using famous hashing algorithm.
          
Things covered in this assignment:
1. Home page which contains links to Login and signuppage
2. Signup page for new users contain username, email, and password fields a default pic will be to them which can be changed on login to there profile page.
3. login page for the exisiting user.
4. Dashbord page is displayed once you login with correct credentials
5. profile page is nothing but details of current logged in user whisch is modifiable
6. last but an impartant thing logout to return back to home page.

Things not covered is:
1. Displaying total number of current users that are active in the page
2. Timestamp for the users.


Thanks!!!!
